#pass means do nothing. If I want to let the condition be like incomplete way and not want any error so use "pass" statement

i = 4
if i>0:
    pass 
print("This is a program of pass statement")

while i>6:
    pass
print("Passing while loop successfully")

def sum(a, b):
    pass    #passed a function. More about function later
